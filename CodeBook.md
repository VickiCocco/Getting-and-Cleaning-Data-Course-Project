#### A brief summary of the data:
"Participants" performed "Activities" while biometric "Features" were measured and recorded as observations.

#### Initial imports and anaylsis for each file
*activity_labels.txt*  - the activities the participants performed
  - The file is read into activity_lablels data_table using "fread" 
  - It contains a activity number variable with unique numbers and corresponding activity name
    
    Activity Number / Activity Name 
     - 1 WALKING
     - 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
     - 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
     - 4 SITTING
     - 5 STANDING
     - 6 LAYING
   
  - Added applicable variable / column names as "activitynumber", "activityname"
  -6 observations of 2 variables
  
  *features.txt* - the features of each test with some parameters
  - The file is read file into features data_table using "fread"  
  - a complete list of features if included in feature_info.txt included in repo
  - It contains a feature number variable with unique numbers adn corresponding feature name
   - eg:  "1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X" , "88 tBodyAccJerk-mad()-Y"
  - Added applicable variable / column names as "featurenumber", "featurename"
  - 561 observations of 2 variables
  
  *feature_info.txt*
  - The file is read file into features_info data_table using "fread" 
  After inspection this file is an information only text file and has been included in this repository
  It contains logical information about the format of more of the datasets
  
  *The train and test directories contain similar number of files and name structure.  After inspection 
  each of the corresponding files can be managed with the same steps but with differing number of observations.*
  
  *subject_test.txt / subject_train.txt*
  - Each file is read file into subject_train or subject_test data_table using "fread" 
  - It contains subject numbers only, and according the assumption outlined in the readme.md, thery are in the 
    same order as the observations in each of the train_y and test_y file described next.
  - Added applicable variable / column name as "subjectnumber"
  - subject_train.txt 7352 observations of 1 variable
  - subject_test.txt 2947 observations of 1 variable
  
  *y_test.txt / y_train.txt*
  - Each file is read file into train_labels or test_labels data_table using "fread" 
  - It contains activity numbers only, 1,2,3,4,5,or 6 and according the assumption outlined in the readme.md, they are in the 
    same order as the observations of the subject activities performed
  - Added applicable variable / column name as "activitynumber"
  - y_train.txt 7352 observations of 1 variable
  - y_test.txt 2947 observations of 1 variable
  
   *X_test.txt / X_train.txt*
  - Each file is read file into train_set or test_set data_table using "fread" 
  - It contains the feature observed value from each of the participants performing each actvity,
    and according the assumption outlined in the readme.md, thery are in the 
    same order as the observations of the subject activities performed, and the features listed
  - Added applicable variable / column names as from the features.txt file
  - X_train.txt 7352 observations of 561 variables
  - X_test.txt 2947 observations of 561 variables
  
  *Inertial Signals directory*
    - this data is read in the r-Script but commented out
    - these files contain further inertial values that are supplementary values to some of the
      features that are observed in the testing
    - these values are not required for the final process but the code remains in the script if 
      the requirements change
  
  ### 2. Descripton of Output Files
    - two data sets are required
    - the first:  
      - merges the training and the test sets to create one data set,
      - extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
      - uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
      - appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    - the second:
      - from the prior data set in create an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each               subject. 
    
    *File layout determination*
         -For this project I am taking directions from features_info.txt literally and looking for featurenames 
          with mean() or std() according to the document, i interpret the 2 "variables" required are feature name and value
        - there are 66 featurenames that are required to be kept
        - Based on the document , I understand that there are three different signals for each measurement, 
        - therefore the separate XYZ are not variables. 
        - Taken from the document as :
        - '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
        - tBodyAcc-X, tBodyAcc-Y, tBodyAcc-Z are all separate signals
        - In a productive environment this should be investigated more
        - there are 66 featurenames that are required to be kept
        - this will be a "long" data set

    * Data Dictionary for data set*

### 3. Coding Walkthru
  - please see Merge Schema file in repo - steps 1 - 6 are in the diagram.  These steps are also documented in the code
  1. The appropriate column / variable names as described in the import descriptions of the files, were applied to teach of the test and train datasets.  The number of observations from the feature.txt file match the number of variables from the X_test and X_train files. 
  
  2. & 3. Each of the data tables made from the X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt have the same number of observations. These were merged into one data table using cbind.  2947 observations of 563 variables
  Each of the data tables made from the X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt have the same number of observations. These were merged into one data table using cbind. 7352 observation of 563 variables
  
  4. Each of the merged test and train datatables have the same number of columns.  They were merged using rbind.
       10299 observations of 563 variables.
       
  5. & 6. The data table for the activity_labels.txt file links the number of the activity to the activity name. The merged data table has only activity numbers in it, it needs the activity names to be tidier.  The activity_labels table is joined as a full join with the merge table on the activity number variable.  The activity number and activity number are now redundant, the activity number column is removed.  The remaining data table is sorted on subject number and activiy name.
